Middleware supports fetch.\r\n// But fetching localhost in middleware can be tricky.\r\n//\r\n// LET'S USE A SIMPLER TRICK: \r\n// We will not use middleware for this specific MVP requirement if it complicates things too much with 'fs'.\r\n// However, the user asked for it.\r\n//\r\n// Let's try to use the 'fs' module in a way that Next.js allows, or just use a global variable? No.\r\n//\r\n// REVISED PLAN:\r\n// We will use a \"Client Component\" wrapper in the RootLayout that checks the maintenance status\r\n// and redirects if needed. This is safer for this specific tech stack (local JSON file).\r\n// Middleware is great but 'fs' access is blocked.\r\n//\r\n// Wait, I can't use 'fs' in middleware.\r\n// I will implement the check in `app/layout.js` or a new `components/MaintenanceCheck.js`.\r\n\r\nexport function middleware(request) {\r\n    // Placeholder middleware if we needed it for auth, but for maintenance with JSON file, \r\n    // it's better to handle it in the application layer or use an external KV store.\r\n    return NextResponse.next();\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const config = {\r\n    matcher: '/:path*',\r\n};\r\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;;;AAqCO,SAAS,WAAW,OAAO;IAC9B,wFAAwF;IACxF,iFAAiF;IACjF,OAAO,uNAAY,CAAC,IAAI;AAC5B;AAEO,MAAM,SAAS;IAClB,SAAS;AACb"}}]
